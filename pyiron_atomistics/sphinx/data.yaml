initialGuess:
  description: In order to start a DFT calculations, one must set up an initial guess for the density and for the wave functions. The initialGuess group defines how this is done, as well as a few other settings (such as keeping the waves on disk to save RAM).  The default is to set up the density from a superposition of atomic densities, and the wave-functions from a single-step LCAO calculation, using the atomic valence orbitals. This works exceptionally well. If you want to finetune the behavior, the initialGuess group must contain a waves or a rho group. Otherwise, you may omit the waves and rho groups to get the default behavior. Additionally, the initialGuess group may contain an occupations group to set up initial occupations (notably when keeping them fixed), and an exchange group for hybrid functionals.
